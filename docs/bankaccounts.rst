Bank accounts
=============

The first thing you should do for the first time is to create a new bank
account. After being logged in, you should be on the page ``/bank-account/``.
You could see *actions links* on the top right corner. Click on *Add*.

Once created, you should see it in the list. Click on it. You should go to the
bank account overview page. From this page, you could navigate to:

* edit the bank account
* delete the bank account (through *action links*)
* schedule bank transactions of this bank account
* see statistics of this bank account
* add bank transactions for that bank account
* filter results with a form
* apply some actions on bank transactions

.. note:: If you have **only one** bank account, you will be redirected to its
   page after being logged in. Otherwise, you will be redirected on the bank
   accounts list page at ``/bank-account/``.
