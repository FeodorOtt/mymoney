Tags

The second step could be to create tags. In the navbar, in *tags* section,
click on *My tags* (``/bank-transaction-tag/list/``). You are on the tags
overview page. From this page, you could apply the following actions on tags:

* add
* edit
* delete

.. note:: Owners of the same bank account could also view/use your tags (so
   even if they are not the owner of the tag). However, a user without
   relationship (i.e: not being the owner of your bank accounts) can't view/use
   your tags.
