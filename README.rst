MyMoney
=======

MyMoney is a personal finance Web application build with the `Django`_
framework.

.. _`Django`: https://www.djangoproject.com/

Goals
-----

* follow and anticipate your bank account balance anywhere
* tag and analyse your expenses
* summarize your recurring expenses/wages
* being as simple as possible

Features
--------

* manage bank accounts (balance, currency, owners, etc)
* manage bank transactions (debit/credit, amount, label, date, reconciled or
  not, payment method, add note, etc)
* tag bank transactions
* analyse bank transactions with graphs (timeline in weeks/months or statistics
  per tags). Use the `Chart.js`_ library.
* schedule recurrent bank transactions
* `Bootstrap`_ integration for mobile
